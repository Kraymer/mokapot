# Description

`pmu` brings actions on top of unix commands<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> using [`percol`](https://github.com/mooz/percol)
_interactive filtering_ concept.

I love `percol` but thought it was lacking from a practical standpoint,
forcing me to manipulate `xargs` and `awk` to pipe it with others commands.  
An alternative would be to use aliases and bash functions but I prefer having
a single script for maintainability.

# Usage

Trigger actions on top of unix commands using percol interactive selection

# Contributing

My use of percol is based on my daily tools hence differs from your needs.
`pmu` should be considered as the place where to store your custom percol one-liners rather than a one-size-fits-all utility.  

You're encouraged to fork it, PR won't be merged unless they deal with a generic use case.
